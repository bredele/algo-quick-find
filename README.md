Quick find algorithm or so called eager algorithm to resolve dynamic connectivity problems.


This algorithm is too expensive. Indeed it takes quadratic time to perform unions on nodes, i.e it takes N^2 access to the array of nodes to process a sequence of N union on nodes. For this reason, you should probably look at different algorithm to resolve dynamic connectivity problems such as the [quick-union](https://github.com/bredele/algo-quick-union) algorithm.


## Usage

```javascript
const algo = require('algo-quick-find')

const nodes = algo([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
nodes.connected(1, 2)
// => false

nodes.union(1, 2)
nodes.connected(1, 2)
// => true
nodes.union(2, 5)
nodes.connected(1, 5)
// => true
```

## Installation

```shell
npm install algo-quick-find --save
```
